Refugee Tech's Projecthub have a similar purpose as refugeeprojects.com, but the main focus of the Platform revolves around Tech projects solving problems related to the inclusion of newcomers into their new homes . It should be beneficial for the community at large to reap what has been developed for this particular purpose onto the general population of projects. And it should be beneficial for the Platforms development to use the general population of projects to implement the projecthub while it develops. Therefor we will branch of the Platforms Project hub to into Initatives: a place for all projects related to aiding the refugee crisis.
